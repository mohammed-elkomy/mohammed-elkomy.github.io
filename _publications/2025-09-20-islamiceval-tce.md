Given the inherent nature of LLMs to hallucinate factual content, the research community developed methodologies for factual verification. However, LLMs are not just limited to hallucinating facts; Arabic religious texts, namely, the Holy Quran and Hadith, were found to be altered by contemporary LLMs, violating their meaning and spreading misconceptions. In this research, we propose a framework to detect and cross-check religious content in generated Arabic text. Our system achieves 86.11% accuracy for segment detection and 89.82% accuracy in content verification from authoritative sources.
