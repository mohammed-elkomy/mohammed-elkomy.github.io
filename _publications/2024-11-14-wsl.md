ðŸŒŸ The paper is titled: Improving Ranking-Based Question Answering with Weak Supervision for Low-Resource Qurâ€™anic Texts.
This work introduces, among other findings, a novel weakly supervised learning mechanism tailored for ranking-based question answering over the Holy Qurâ€™an.
Here are the main contributions of the research:

1. We present a novel learning method for machine reading comprehension that utilizes weak supervision signals specifically for question answering in a ranking context. This approach aligns closely with the inherent ranking nature of the task.
2. Using our proposed learning method, we achieve statistically significant, state-of-the-art performance on the QRCD dataset, surpassing results reported in prior studies.
3. To support further research, weâ€™re making our trained models, experiments, and codes open-source for the community.

This paper is part of my series on the Qurâ€™an QA challenge, organized by the BigIR group. (Dr. Tamer Elsayed, Dr. Rana Malhas, and Watheq Mansour)
Qurâ€™an QA is a research challenge that took place twice in 2023 and 2022  attracting young researchers to develop MRC and ad hoc search solutions for the Holy text.
