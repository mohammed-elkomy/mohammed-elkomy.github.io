conducting research at <a href="https://dami-lab.github.io/" title="DAMI">DAMI</a> lab and fortunately advised by
Dr. <a href="https://yaoma24.github.io/" title="Yao Ma">Yao Ma</a>.
My primary research focuses on knowledge graphs, large language models, and data valuation.


I defended my Masterâ€™s degree in late 2023, specializing in information retrieval and question answering at the Computer Engineering Department of [Tanta University](https://tanta.edu.eg/en/). My research was gratefully **co-supervised** by [Dr. Moustafa F. Alzantot](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AusbFkQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Amany Sarhan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zonuuE0AAAAJ&hl=en).

My academic career began after completing my military service in October 2020 ðŸ«¡. Prior to this, I graduated with honors from in August 2018, ranking first among a cohort of more than 160 students in Computer Engineering Department at Tanta University.

During my previous career at my local university in Egypt ð“‚€, I found great fulfillment in sharing knowledge and mentoring students. I aspire to become a recognized scholar in this rapidly evolving field and to cultivate the next generation of researchers in my community.
