ðŸ“£ Update: I've recently relocated to the United States to begin my graduate studies. As of September 2025, Iâ€™m no longer offering freelancing services on Fiverr.

I have three years of experience working on Fiverr freelancing platform as a Level-Two Freelance Data Scientist and Python Developer.
I leverage my skills in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Python automation to facilitate the lives of my clients on Fiverr.
I can tackle various tasks and challenges in these areas, such as image analysis or text processing automation pipelines.
Typically, my services are designed to streamline and automate repetitive tasks using versatile open-source Python tools.
This includes extracting and manipulating data from PDF files, performing OCR and document analysis, as well as generating comprehensive reports and summaries.
